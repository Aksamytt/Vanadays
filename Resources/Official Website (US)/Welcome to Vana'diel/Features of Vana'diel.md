# Transportation

## Chocobos

![[Attachments/0001/chocobos.jpg]]

These large, herbivorous birds are unable to fly, but their powerful legs allow them to run at high speeds. In the past, the Elvaan primarily used chocobos as mounts--but as of late, chocobos have been raised all over the world and are a popular form of transportation. Great skill is required to ride them due to their wild nature.

Chocobos were originally native to the La Theine Plateau, but the untamed members of the species have long since become extinct. These birds are very fond of gysahl greens.

## Selbina-Mhaura Ferry

![[Attachments/0001/selbina-mhaura_ferry.jpg]]

This ferry is actually a cargo ship that carries adventurers across the Bastore Sea from Selbina (on the continent of Quon) to Mhaura (on the continent of Mindartia). The ferry runs three times a day. Though these ferry ships once relied on the ever changing winds to power their sails, the three-vessel fleet now moves with the speed of internal combustion engines, thanks to the technology of Bastok.
The Selbina-Mhaura Ferry's main purpose is to transport goods, but the boats are not exactly equipped for moving passengers. However, the ferry features a small shop to provide the bare bones essentials for those who are making the journey.

## Airships

![[Attachments/0001/airships.jpg]]

These skyfaring vessels were built under the direction of Cid, the genius engineer. Based on an old set of blueprints, the airships of today are fitted with crystal-powered engines that were reintroduced by the Archduke of Jeuno. With lift provided by unique revolving wings and propulsion supplied by the crystal engine, airships are capable of nearly vertical takeoffs and landings from their waterfront ports.

Towards the end of the Great War, in the year 864 of the Crystal Era, the first airship was constructed as a secret weapon of the allied forces. After several successful test flights, the airship was expected to play a major role in the final battle. However, due to the sudden conclusion of the war, it was never used in actual combat.
After the war, there was a drive towards the strengthening of relations between the four countries. Under the auspices of the Archduke of Jeuno, the air travel agency was founded in 873 CE to provide a fast, reliable mode of transport for both travelers and cargo. The refitting of Port Bastok began at the same time that plans were revealed to build larger airships.

A regular airship route between Jeuno and Bastok was established in 875 CE. Upon witnessing the successful operation of the Bastokan airship service, the previously skeptical nations of San d'Oria and Windurst raced to refit their own ports for airship use. These developments led to the birth of a new large-scale, high-speed transportation service for each country.

As well as triggering a revolution in the distribution of goods, the appearance of the airship is seen as an indirect cause for the emergence of modern adventurers, who do not choose their friends on the basis of nationality.

The reopened route to Kazham has recently seen an explosive increase in the number of passengers.

# Crystals and Synthesis

## Crystals and Synthesis

![[Attachments/0001/crystals_and_synthesis.jpg]]

There are instances when the energy flowing through Vana'diel becomes concentrated and changes into a crystalline form. Combined with an image made by the user, the energy of these crystals can be focused onto other ingredients, resulting in new products. This process is known as crystal synthesis.

## The Attributes of Crystals

- Fire crystal: Heat
- Water crystal: Dissolve
- Earth crystal: Bond
- Wind crystal: Carve
- Ice crystal: Congeal
- Lightning crystal: Split
- Light crystal: Restore
- Dark crystal: Decay

# Facilities

## Mog House

![[Attachments/0001/mog_house.jpg]]

These one-room apartments have been set aside in the residential areas of each nation for the sole use of adventurers. Those who rent a private Mog House are free to furnish the rooms as they please, and all rental fees are subsidized by the four nations as a part of the conquest policy taken up after the Great War.
Also, as the name implies, a Moogle is present in each Mog House. These Moogles have been dispatched by the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) to support adventurers by dealing with the matters of each individual Mog House. The Moogles' jobs include the management of the renters' goods, upkeep of the room, and various other required services. Finally, in addition to Mog Houses, rent-a-rooms are available for adventurers who travel far from their home nations. These fully equipped rooms are also offered free of charge; however, the completion of an application form is necessary before an adventurer may enter.

## Auction Houses

![[Attachments/0001/auction_houses.jpg]]

Private investors are responsible for the establishment of the auction houses. These centers of commerce exist in the heart of each nation, and are truly vital for adventurers. The main purpose of the auction house system is to provide a means of circulating goods required for successful adventuring. This system works on the principle of awarding goods put up on auction to the highest bidder.

It is said that the lack of readily available supplies after the Great War is what gave rise to Jeuno's black market. However, with increasing numbers of adventures, the auction house business prospered--and new auction houses sprung up everywhere as each country sought to gain a piece of the profits. With the addition of delivery services and a revolutionary style of management utilizing linkpearls (allowing business to be conducted in remote areas such as Kazham), the auction houses have truly become a convenient form of trading.

The windows of the auction houses are constructed in such a way that the staff are not visible to the customers. This is a security measure for the safety of the employees, and a deterrent to thieves.

## Consulates / Embassies

![[Attachments/0001/consulates-embassies.jpg]]

After the Great War, the four nations of the Allied Army began negotiations aimed at strengthening their relationships. With the conclusion of these negotiations came the establishment of the new consulates.
The consuls and consul guards have many responsibilities, such as ensuring the safety of their nation's adventurers and the profits of their merchants, as well as acting as a bridge between nations.
Finally, during the Great War, many battles were lost due to the indecisiveness of the four nations. Learning from this dilemma, embassies (not consuls) have been established in Jeuno. These embassies have been given high levels of authority, and are allowed to act in times of emergency without the direct authorization of their nations.

## Gatehouses

![[Attachments/0001/gatehouses.jpg]]

These are areas within the city gates where several guards are stationed. There are always high-ranking border guards and other soldiers on duty to keep beastmen and monsters at bay. Adventurer-oriented services, such as bestowing Signet and issuing conquest orders, are often conducted here.

## Shops

![[Attachments/0001/shops.jpg]]

There are many types of shops in Vana'diel, ranging from well-established private and guild-run stores to open-air stalls and merchants that ply their wares from any available space. Shops run the gamut from weapon, armor, magic, and music shops to taverns, milliners, and apothecaries. Adventurers can also be seen peddling their wares, and a wise shopper compares the prices of all the different shops, merchants, and auction house goods to get the best buy.

## Border Guards

![[Attachments/0001/border_guards.jpg]]

Border guards are elite soldiers that are dispatched to both foreign consulates and territories under their nation's control. These soldiers have many duties beyond simply patrolling borders. These include casting Signet on adventurers, protecting consulates, and contributing towards the conquest efforts of their respective nations. Border guards belong to the military organizations of each country. Their titles and abbreviations are as follows:


- San d'Oria
	- R.K. (Royal Knights)
	- T.K. (Temple Knights)
- Bastok
	- I.M. (Iron Musketeers)
- Windurst
	- W.W. (War Warlocks)

## Outposts

![[Attachments/0001/outposts.jpg]]

Border guards are assigned to these wilderness posts to oversee conquest efforts and provide support for adventurers. Some of these outposts are constructed with simple guardhouses and defensive walls.
