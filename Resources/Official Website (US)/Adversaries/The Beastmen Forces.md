# Introduction

In addition to the main five races on Vana'diel, there also exists several races of semi-intelligent beings. These groups are collectively known as "beastmen," and each has their own stronghold (territory).

# Orcs

Lust for combat drives most of the Orcs to join the ranks of their Imperial Army. All Orcs--male and female--are required to participate in years of military training, and even their social structure is based on military ranks.

# Quadav

As their shells thicken with age, the titles given to individual Quadav change. Within their strict caste system, those chosen to serve in the Elite Guard are given titles portraying hard and precious metals, while those chosen to be magicians are given titles taken from rare gems.

# Yagudo

The self-proclaimed conquerors of the Mindartia continent, the Yagudo created and abide by a Theomilitary system based on their ancient religion. Due to the ties to their religion, these birdlike beastmen often have names taken from theological origins.

# Goblins

Unlike other beastmen, Goblins can be found in most regions across Vana'diel. Their flexible lifestyle and adaptability to the surrounding environment have given them the ability to coexist with other beastmen as well as people. Compared to other beastmen, Goblins have developed superior techniques in trades such as smithing and healing.

# Antica

![[Attachments/0001/antica.jpg]]

The Antica have transformed the former Galkan capital of Altepa into the central location of their empire, which spreads across the islands of Kuzotz. Their militaristic society is built upon advanced personnel management abilities. Upon birth, all individuals are given a number, and a job for which they spend the rest of their lives training. Apart from the information needed to perform their duties, the individual is not allowed any other knowledge. An Antica is only allowed to transfer positions to become a gladiator (used for population control).

The Antica have no concept of personal belongings. All equipment is provided by the Empire, and food rations are based solely on the duties performed by the individual. However, due to their lack of emotion, there is not a single Antica who feels discontent towards this system. This can also be seen on the battlefield. No matter the situation, the lack of fluctuation in morale is the Antica's greatest strength.

Another strength lies in the sheer number of Antica soldiers. In addition to their active legions, an enormous surplus of soldiers lies in stasis within the Antica's stronghold. When revived, the size of their army can increase a hundredfold. However, due to their lack of naval technology, only a few of their troops were able to participate in the Great War campaigns carried out on Quon; their presence had little effect on the outcome of the battles. It is widely believed that had the full Antican army participated in the battles on Quon, the allied forces surely would have been defeated.

While the Antica communicate by fricative sounds made within their necks, they are unable to release loud war cries like the other beastmen. This results in an eerie silence on the battlefield that can send chills down the spine of even the bravest warrior.

# Sahagin

These amphibious beastmen reside mainly on the western coastline of the island of Elshimo. They spend the majority of their time practicing primitive fishing techniques to provide an ample supply of shellfish for their survival. Other than to protect their territory, the Sahagin rarely interact with other races. Before the Great War, they adamantly refused invitations by the Shadow Lord to join the beastmen armies--until he convinced them that the steamships of Bastok would eventually destroy their environment. During the war, the Sahagin used their sea maneuvering abilities to attack even the strongest ships in the allied fleet, and were feared by all seafaring soldiers. After the flames of battle had been extinguished, the Sahagin cut off all ties to the other beastmen and returned to their secluded way of life. Apart from limited trading with Norg--they often trade shellfish for metal trinkets salvaged by the pirates--the Sahagin have little contact with the outside world.

Finally, many of the Sahagin worship the elements, and have made deities out of sea serpents and oddly shaped stones within their grotto. However, within their ranks are some who follow the teachings of the Goddess Altana.

# Tonberries

These tiny beastmen live solely in the Yhoator Jungle on the eastern half of Elshimo. The Tonberries possess a great deal of anger, or "rancor," in their hearts. It is this anger that binds them as a tribe while driving them to commit terrible acts against all other beings. During the Great War, the majority of the Tonberries remained in their stronghold, the Temple of Uggalepih. However, a few elite members of the tribe were sent to the Shadow Lord to act as his secret agents. These Tonberries would often sneak into the castles of the allied forces and assassinate important generals or political figures. Feared around Vana'diel, these beastmen were often referred to as the "invisible killers."

According to the Tonberries' religion, their creator, the Goddess Uggalepih, had beauty that was envied by the Goddess Altana. A furious Altana transformed Uggalepih into a hideous beast and exiled her to the Outlands. revenge for Altana's actions is said to be one of the origins of their rancor.

Finally, the reason why they are never found without their lanterns or knives is explained in the following verses, often chanted by the Tonberries before battle:

> "O brothersss of rancor, take up thy lanternsss,
> The truth we shall illuminate.
> O sistersss of rancor, take up thy knives,
> To cleave our foesss with barren hate.
> Through this we ssseek our just reward;
> Our goddess's glory be ressstored."

# Gigas

![[Attachments/0001/gigas.jpg]]

"Gigas" is the general term for enormous members of the Gigas, Giant, and Jotunn tribes. Groups of these giants can be found roaming the island of Qufim. As their appearances imply, the Gigas do not possess much in the way of intelligence. While they do possess a language, it consists of the stringing together of simple words or phrases. Their language is often unintelligible--even by members of their own kind. However, what they lack in intelligence is made up for in brute strength. Also, while not as advanced as that of the allied forces, their ship and castle building abilities are comparable to those of the Orcs or Yagudo.

The Gigas were originally from an island far to the north of Quon. Every few decades, the Gigas send a large ship to Qufim to attack the Hume settlements. Their goal is to retrieve supplies and slaves to take back to their homeland. Before the Great War, the Shadow Lord recognized the potential that lay in the giants, and hired a large number of them to fight as mercenaries. After helping to construct Castle Zvahl, the Gigas led the beastman frontline in laying siege to many of the allied forces' fortresses. However, when the beastmen lost the war, the remaining Gigas were left trapped, unable to return to their homeland in the north. With nowhere to go, they set off for Qufim and Delkfutt's Tower, where they remain today--out of reach of the allied armies.

# Demons

![[Attachments/0001/demons.jpg]]

These winged beastmen are found mainly in the Valdeaunia Region. It is said that their damage-absorbing outer shell was once armor that was enhanced by an evil enchantment. In addition to their highly advanced fighting skills, they are also known to possess high levels of intelligence, which they have used to acquire various types of potent magic. Due to their pitch-black color and ominous appearance, the inhabitants of Vana'diel came to call these beastmen "Demons." However, Demons refer to themselves as "the Kindred." This, along with many other questions about their origins, still remain unanswered.

During the Great War, the Demons served as the Shadow Lord's elite guard, ruling over the other beastmen with fear. To ensure the other beastmen were following orders, many of the Demons would act as messengers, traveling to and from Castle Zvahl. When the Great War was over, the Demons vanished. However, with recent rumors of the Shadow Lord's return, there have been Demon sightings in Valdeaunia. While there are many theories about their origin, the most popular one is that the Shadow Lord made a pact with them after traveling deep into hell.
