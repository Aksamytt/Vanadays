# Mandragora

![[Attachments/0001/mandragora.jpg]]

Through the process of evolution, this sentient form of plant life has developed its own independent culture; the society boasts clothing, homes, and a form of extrasensory communication. While seemingly cute and harmless in appearance, the Mandragora sense of values differs greatly from that of people or beastmen. These differences often cause friction between the species.
The Mandragora receive nourishment from the sun via photosynthesis, which occurs in the leaves that grow on their heads. Merchants treasure these rare leaves, which can be sold for use in medicines and perfumes.
