# Orcish Grappler

These fighters are trained in the ways of the martial arts, their iron fists serving as their only weapons. Due to their unparalleled strength, most of the grapplers' techniques cannot be imitated by even the strongest of warriors.

# Wild Rabbit

Wild rabbits were introduced to the wooded areas of Ronfaure when the pet rabbits of Elvaan nobles escaped from their cages into the surrounding forests. Over the centuries they have turned violent--undeniably due to their consumption of the poisonous plants that grow in the area. While relatively small in size, these mammals will use their powerful hind legs to attack anything that poses a threat to their nests. Also, their tendency to fight in small groups has taken even the strongest of adventurers off guard. While relatively tough and gamy in flavor, wild rabbit meat is a popular commodity in San d'Oria--as are the soft, cold-resistant skins. The Tarutaru on Mindartia also raise rarabs, distant cousins of the rabbits, as one of their food sources.

# Scarab Beetle

These giant insects are found mostly in the northern forests of Quon. While their main source of nourishment consists of tree sap, they have been known to attack travelers who unknowingly wander into their territory. Well aware of the threats that the beetles pose, the Tarutaru sing a folk song of how to protect oneself:

"When you're walking through the beetle's garden
There is one thing you musty-wusty know,
Burn incense when the sun is high,
Put out your lamps when it is lowy-low."

The pliable yet strong shells of these beetles are easy to manipulate, and have long been used by the Mithra to make traditional ornaments and jewelry.
