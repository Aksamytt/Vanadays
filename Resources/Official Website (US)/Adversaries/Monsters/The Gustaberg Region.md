# Tunnel Worm

These annelids can be found in nearly every region on the Quon continent. According to Elvaan biologist Baron Clavoaire, the tunnel worm is a peaceful animal that quietly feeds on soil and rock deep below the surface of Vana'diel. However, mistakenly consuming a crystal causes the worm to become disorientated, often resulting in movement toward the surface. The rhythmical vibrations caused by passing adventurers send the worms into a panic, resulting in their sudden appearances above ground.
Due to their unusual eating habits, undigested rare ores are often found within the worms' stomachs.

# Ornery Sheep

Hume and Elvaan farmers raise this type of Selbina sheep predominantly in the Zulkheim region. However, these animals are far from tame, and are often left to graze freely about the open plains and plateaus. There have been numerous incidents where adventurers and even shepherds have been attacked by the livestock. Their particularly violent nature often triggers similar behavior in lesser-tempered sheep, forcing farmers to turn to adventurers to rid them of the problematic animals. The large amounts of wool and meat that can be obtained from the ornery sheep serve as ample rewards for the adventurers' services.

# Rock Lizard

This reptile feeds on the rotting carcasses of prey slain by other animals. However, rock lizards will attack when there is a lack of food in the area, or if they sense that their potential prey is in a significantly weakened state. While this lizard's massive jaw is capable of crushing large rocks, its poor eyesight prevents it from detecting enemies unless they are close by. With proper caution, it is possible to pass rock lizards completely unnoticed.
The thick, durable skins of the rock lizards have been used in Vana'dielian shoes and armor for centuries.
