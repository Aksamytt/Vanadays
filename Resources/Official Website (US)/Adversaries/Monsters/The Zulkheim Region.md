# Goblin Butcher

![[Attachments/0001/goblin_butcher.jpg]]

These traveling butchers deal in everything from rabbit meat to Hume meat. Many of the beastmen who purchase from them favor the pungent flavor of rotten flesh, so freshness is of little importance to these merchants.

# Ghoul

![[Attachments/0001/ghoul.jpg]]

These undead skeletons are found in every region of Vana'diel. It is said that the souls of gluttons in life are doomed to an undeath of feeding on the flesh of mortals. The stomach of a ghoul is completely rotted away, and the inability to sate their hunger no matter how many corpses they consume causes these undead to be particularly violent.
