These mystics spout out all kinds of prophecies with very little meaning. The vague nature of the omens seems to be preferable to the beastmen, however, allowing them to invent their own interpretations.

# Goobbue

The goobbue is a large amphibious creature that inhabits the Derfland region. These voracious omnivores use their flexible, whip-like arms and dislocatable jaws to swallow down practically anything they come across. The parasitic moss that grows in the folds of the goobbue's back is highly valued as an ingredient in various potions and medicines.

# Ochu

This is a variety of the man-eating morbol that makes its home in the rolanberry Fields. The ochu draws in its prey by giving off a sweet-sour aroma similar to that of the rolanberry, most likely a scent acquired from its prolonged proximity to the sought-after fruit. As a result of the horticultural magic soaked into the fields, the ochu has weaker tendrils and a faster growth rate than other morbols.
